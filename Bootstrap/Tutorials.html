    <h1>HTML5 INTRODUCTION - Start Your Web Development Journey</h1>
    <p>So you want to be a web developer. In web development on the client-side, you have to majorly deal with 3 things: contents, style and logic.</p>
    <p>To manage with content like text, images, videos, etc you have to learn HTML.</p>
    <p>HTML is the basic building block of your web development journey. Whatever you see in the browser either on desktop, tablet or mobile all the contents are encapsulated in any HTML element.</p>

    <h2>What Is HTML5?</h2>
    <p><b>HTML</b> is a markup language that stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML with the addition of some new tag and improvement to some existing ones.</p>

    <p>HTML is the most basic language which is necessary if you want to learn web development. It is used to create core part of web pages like inserting text, images, videos, audios, etc.</p>
    <center><img src="C:\Users\Ashwini\Pictures\Saved Pictures\webpage.webp"></center>
    <p>It creates the basic structure of web pages using different <a href="https://www.tutorialstonight.com/html/html-tags">tags</a> and <a href=https://www.tutorialstonight.com/html/html-element>elements</a> by nesting these inside each other creating a hierarchical tree-like structure.</p>
    <p>It is to be noted that HTML a <b>markup language</b>, not a programming language and these 2 are very different things.</p>
    <p>HTML is not considered a programming language because in HTML:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no way to store value</li>
      <li>There no logic creation</li>
      <li>There is no control system</li>
      <li>There are no ways to repeat a task</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to start HTML?</h2>
    <p>In HTML we only deal with how to represent text, image, videos, etc on a webpage using the browser.

      <p>For this, we have specific HTML tags for each special task. Like for paragraph we have <p> tag, for image we have <img> tag and so on.</p>
      <p>These tags with their content are known as HTML element. A web page consists of a series of HTML elements, which is nested in each other and enclose contents of web pages.</p>
      <p>For example, look at the picture below how HTML elements nest each other and hold contents.</p>
